# synthbox
This is an Arduino wavetable synth based largely on DZL's design - https://github.com/dzlonline/the_synth.

The code for my design is highly reliant on what DZL did. Their code and easy-to-build circuit design is fantastic, and makes it an awesome synth project.

I was interested in making it a standalone synth with adjustable controls that could be adjusted live, on-the-fly.

So I added potentiometers and tweaked the code to control some of the parameters.

I honestly don't have my head fully wrapped around how DZL's original code works, I basically did a lot of trial and error until it started making sounds I liked.

The synth.h and tables.h code are entirely DZL's work. Basically 99.9% of the code is DZL's work, I just added some knobs.
